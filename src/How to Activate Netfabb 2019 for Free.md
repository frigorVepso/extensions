However, if you want to use it beyond the trial period, you will need to activate it with a valid license key. In this article, we will show you how to activate Netfabb 2019 for free using a simple method.
 
## Step 1: Download and install Netfabb 2019
 
The first step is to download and install Netfabb 2019 on your computer. You can get the installer from the official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. Make sure you choose the right version for your operating system (Windows or Mac).
 
Once you have downloaded the installer, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to accept the terms and conditions and enter some information. When the installation is complete, launch Netfabb 2019 from your desktop or start menu.
 
## Step 2: Disable your internet connection
 
The next step is to disable your internet connection before activating Netfabb 2019. This is because the software will try to verify your license key online and may detect that it is invalid or expired. To disable your internet connection, you can either unplug your ethernet cable, turn off your Wi-Fi, or use airplane mode on your device.
 
Once you have disabled your internet connection, go back to Netfabb 2019 and click on the "Activate" button on the free trial screen. You should see a window asking you to enter your serial number and product key.
 
## Step 3: Enter a fake serial number and product key
 
The final step is to enter a fake serial number and product key that will trick Netfabb 2019 into thinking that you have a valid license. You can generate these numbers using an online tool such as X-Force Keygen[^2^] or find them on other websites[^3^] [^4^]. Make sure you choose the right numbers for Netfabb 2019 Standard or Ultimate, depending on which version you want to activate.
 
For example, you can use these numbers for Netfabb 2019 Standard:
 
- Serial number: 666-69696969
- Product key: 871K1

Or these numbers for Netfabb 2019 Ultimate:

- Serial number: 666-69696969

Enter these numbers in the corresponding fields and click on "Next". You should see a message saying that your activation was successful. Click on "Finish" and enjoy using Netfabb 2019 for free!
